# AI-Engineering---Capstone-Project-
Final Project for AI Keystone Project

1) The .ipynb file is the code for the Project (reduced batch size - 16, float16)
2) The screenshot is the output of the model.fit - I was able to run it only once completely, but it did not save my model. Am attempting it again, but may not get done before end of course submission day.
